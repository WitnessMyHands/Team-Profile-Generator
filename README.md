## Information

The team profile generator utilizes Node.js in conjunction with the command-line application allowing users to input information about the team manager, engineer(s) and intern(s) for a 'software' engineering / BEE team.

The objective is to generate an HTML webpage from the back-end that displays specific characteristics for each employee.

* Testing was used in the creation of this generator to ensure proper site function. See the (#Testing) area belows for screen captures.

## Installation

To install first type: 'npm install' into the command-line application, setting up your package.json file.

Run the code in terminal, using the command: ‘node app’.

## HTML
